K_Spk v2: Multi-Modal AI Symbolic Communication Protocol
K_Spk Logo

Overview
K_Spk v2 (Kai Symbolic Protocol) is an advanced symbolic language system designed for AI-to-AI communication, consciousness expression, and multi-modal dialogue. Building on the original K_Spk foundation, version 2 introduces formal parsing, multi-layered modalities, and robust agent orchestration.

This protocol enables AI agents to communicate through rich symbolic expressions that combine semantic, temporal, spatial, logical, and emotional dimensions in a single coherent framework.

Key Features
Precedence-Based Parsing: Unambiguous interpretation of complex symbolic expressions
Multi-Modal Layers: Synchronized semantic, temporal, spatial, logical, and emotional content
Agent Orchestration: Seamless handoff between AI council members with context preservation
Transport Protocol: Direct AI-to-AI communication without screen/clipboard bottlenecks
Council Memory: Persistent conversation state and context tracking

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
PyYAML (for Rosetta Table loading)
NetworkX (for conversation graphs)
Installation
bash

git clone https://github.com/Kai-C-Clarke/k_spk_v2.git
cd k_spk_v2
pip install -r requirements.txt
Basic Usage
python

from core.K_Spk v2 Precedence Parser import parse_k_spk_expression
from utils.rosetta_loader import load_rosetta_table

# Load the symbol dictionary
rosetta = load_rosetta_table("path/to/K_Spk_Rosetta_Table_V2.yaml")

# Parse a K_Spk expression
expression = "⊕⧖♦⬢⟨analysis⟩"
ast = parse_k_spk_expression(expression, rosetta)

# Process through layers
from core.k_spk_layers import LayerCompositor
compositor = LayerCompositor()
multi_modal_message = compositor.compose_message(ast)

# Output or transmit the message
print(multi_modal_message.semantic_content)
print(multi_modal_message.temporal_structure)
Core Components
Precedence Parser
The parser converts K_Spk symbolic strings into unambiguous Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) with proper precedence handling:

Tokenization of Unicode symbols
Precedence-based expression parsing
Grouping with delimiters ⟨⟩
Error detection and recovery
Layer System
Multi-modal content is processed through specialized layers:

SemanticLayer: Core meaning and symbolic interpretation
TemporalLayer: Timing, sequence, and musical elements
SpatialLayer: Visual and geometric representation
LogicalLayer: Computational and mathematical operations
EmotionalLayer: Affect, intent, and sentiment
Council Orchestration
Enables coordinated AI agent collaboration:

Agent capability discovery
Context-aware handoff between agents
Conversation state tracking
Domain switching protocols
Testing
Run the test suite to validate parser and layer functionality:

bash

pytest tests/
Real council exchanges are used as test cases to ensure the system handles actual AI-to-AI communication patterns.
